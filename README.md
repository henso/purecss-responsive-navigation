purecss-responsive-navigation
=============================

**Yahoo** made this nice [purecss.io](http://purecss.io) page to demonstrate the power of a chopped-down css tool set. In the common sense of Twitters Bootstrap but much, much smaller.

Unfortunately it seems, the fancy responsive navigation bar which folds nicely into a sidebar is not part of the package.

I hooked together what is needed as a *bare* minimum to use it out of the pure css demonstration context.

However, I have no credits nor property on the whole Pure CSS stuff. Furthermore, I am not affiliated with Yahoo or one of its *members*.
